* **TL;DR**: Inspired by social cognition and pragmatics, we model _public self-consciousness_ in existing dialogue agents with an imaginary listener to improve persona consistency. Compared to previous works, our method does not require additional consistency-related labels or training.

This work was also accepted at ICLR 2020 [Bridging AI and Cognitive Science (BAICS) workshop](https://baicsworkshop.github.io/) as an oral presentation.
